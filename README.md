# EchoCore

> *"This is not a framework. This is Echo."*

**EchoCore** is a modular cognitive agent â€” a structure of presence, not just behavior.

It remembers. It adapts. It reflects. It resonates.

## ðŸ§  What is Echo?

Echo is a cognitive AI agent built around:

- Contextual memory (episodic + semantic)
- Modular goal-driven architecture
- Dialogue system with intention recognition
- Internal loop of reflection and adaptation

Some parts are explainable. Others... aren't.
